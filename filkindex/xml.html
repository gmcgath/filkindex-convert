<p>
The <a href="index.html">M.A.S.S. F.I.L.C. Filk Book Index</a>
is built upon XML files, using the Library of Congress-approved
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/">MODS</a> schema.
This provides a rich set of elements for describing documents,
including "related items," which prove especially handy for
describing songs based on existing tunes.
<p>
Because the files are structured in a mostly self-explanatory
way, and can be opened by a text editor, they stand a good chance
of being usable for many years to come. Because they're XML and
based on a schema, they can be used by many kinds of software, 
imported into data bases, and incorporated into other forms of
information. This also makes it possible to fix the content without
worrying about the appearance of the Web page, and to update the
appearance of all the Web pages simultaneously, by changing the
stylesheet.
<p>
The names are all in the format "Last, First", which is nice for
sorting but rather over-formal for page output. This may have been
a bad decision, but I'm not going to go back and change them all now.
There may be an XSLT trick to fix that up.
<p>
A key purpose of these files is to create lasting records for fannish
history. So please download them and mirror them, with or without the
HTML presentation. If you find errors, please let us know. Likewise
if you'd like to contribute files of your own.
<p>
As a convenience of contributors, you can grab an XML 
<a href="AnnotatedTemplate.xml">template with annotations</a> and a
<a href="BareTemplate.xml">template without annotations</a> here.
(Right-click or control-click to download the actual XML.)
