filkindex-convert
=================

Java app for aiding creation of entries in the Filk Book Index.

The Filk Book Index (http://www.massfilc.org/filkindex/) is a collection of MODS XML files
with information on books of filk songs. The MODS format is complicated to create, so this
application allows conversion of CSV files to XML. Some hand tweaking will generally be
necessary, but this lets contributors who aren't fluent in the MODS schema create spreadsheets
with information to convert. The main page of the filk book index has links to spreadsheet
templates in Excel and OpenDocument formats.

The application will run in the command line, with the arguments being the input and output
files.
